# Dream-Team
API and Vanilla JS
Our first group project. We decided to build a hiking trail finder application, similar in style to the dating
app Tinder. We utilized several API's, firebase for datastorage and authentication, as well as HTML, CSS and Javascript, including
frameworks such as jQuery.
